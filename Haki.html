      <h1>What is Haki?</h1>
      <p>
        Haki is a mysterious power that allows the user to utilize their own
        spiritual energy for various purposes. All living beings in the world
        are capable of learning Haki; however, most people do not notice it or
        fail to awaken it. Haki users are common in the New World, rare in
        Paradise, and basically non-existent in the Four Blues.There are three
        different types of Haki that can be used to sense people's spiritual
        energy and predict their actions, give the user a protective coating of
        spiritual energy, and, for a certain group of "chosen ones", overpower
        the willpower of others.
      </p>
      <h1>Observation Haki</h1>
      <p>
        Observation Haki, which gives the user a sixth sense of the world around
        them, allowing them to sense the presence, strength, and emotions of
        other people, even if they are out of sight or far away. It also grants
        limited precognitive abilities, allowing the user to sense their
        opponents' intentions and predict their actions and attacks before they
        happen. An advanced level of observation allows the user to actually
        foresee a short period into the future. Luffy's ability raches to the
        advanced observation where he can see some seconds to the future.
      </p>
      <h1>Armament Haki</h1>
      <p>
        Armament Haki, which allows the user to use their own spiritual energy
        as armor to defend against attacks, as well as make their own attacks
        more potent. It can also be used to bypass Devil Fruit defenses, such as
        Logia intangibility. A person can apply the armament to a section of
        their body, over their entire body, and even imbue it onto their
        weapons. A coating of Busoshoku will cause the coated area to turn a
        shiny black, and a particularly thick and powerful coating will have a
        flame-like pattern along its edge. An advanced level of Busoshoku allows
        the user to emit the armament a short distance without a medium. A
        higher grade of advanced Busoshoku allows the user to make the emitted
        armament flow into a target's body and destroy it from the inside out.
        Luffy can use all the advanced haki of this as well.
      </p>
      <h1>Conquers Haki</h1>
      <p>
        Conqueror's Haki, which grants the user the ability to unleash their own
        willpower to overpower the will of others.[3] This results in victims
        being mentally overwhelmed by the user, with particularly weak-willed
        foes instantly losing consciousness. It can also apply pressure onto
        objects and damage them, a clash between two particularly strong
        Haoshoku users is capable of "splitting the heavens". Unlike the other
        types of Haki which can be learned by anyone, Haoshoku is rare ability
        that only one in several million people are born with the ability to
        use. An advanced level of Haoshoku allows the user to infuse their
        conquering spirit into their weapons and physical attacks, greatly
        augmenting their power. Only a small handful of the most powerful
        conquers haki users are able to achieve this.[ Another advanced level of
        Haoshoku allows for the ability to manipulate one's aura or presence,
        which negates an opponent's ability to sense the user with observation
        Haki.[30]
